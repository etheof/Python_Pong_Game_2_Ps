Python_Pong_Game_2_Ps
=====================

Classic Pong game in Python for 2 players (NO AI)

The good old Pong game is back.
The only innvative thing is player controls, one uses the mouse, the other the up and down arrow keys. 
Still no graphics, just rectangles, no AI, just reverses the ball speed once it hits the player's paddle or top-bottom walls.

Game was created for an interview thingy. (Nope didn't get the job)

Cheers
